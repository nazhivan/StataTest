This work-in-progress website is designed for students interested in learning how to analyze data in STATA. It is intended for student taking "Intro to Econometrics" course at the undergraduate level. Students can learn how to do basic commands in STATA and to create do/log files.

Students are encouraged to create a separate folder for the course "IntroEconometrics" where all course and Stata related files can be saved. It will make easy for students to code and analyze the data.

1. Types of file in STATA
While STATA has several types of files, there are three MAIN types of files that will be used here:
- .dta files - these files contain data in STATA format; note that several other formats of data, such as, .csv, .xls, etc. can be imported into STATA.
- .do files - these text files contain list of commands that can be executed and edited in the future even after STATA is closed; it is always recommended to create .do file for each project you do. **REMEMBER to save it!**
